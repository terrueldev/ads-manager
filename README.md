# ads-manager

A ads-manager project

## Getting Started

This project was scaffolded with SDD. To add your first feature:

```bash
/sdd I want to create a new feature
```

This will guide you through:
1. Creating a specification for your feature
2. Planning the implementation
3. Building it step by step

## Development

Once you have features implemented:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

Database and contract operations are performed via SDD commands:

```
/sdd set up the database        # Deploy local database (requires K8s)
/sdd forward the database port  # Forward database port
/sdd generate TypeScript types  # Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI
```
